                <p className="display-info">Hey, I'm Karis, I'm a junior front end developer currently based in London. 
                    I used to work within the finance field processing invoices, reconciling bank statements,
                    and dealing with many exciting accounting tasks ðŸ«£.
                    I have used various free websites to learn; HTML5, CSS, JS & React 
                    (It's work in progress and am enjoying the journey).
                    In my spare time I love travelling, trying new restraunts and weight training!</p>
